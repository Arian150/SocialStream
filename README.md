SocialStream
============

The Social Stream application is a "river of news" for Windows 7 touch screens (including the SUR40 product) which displays an endless stream of items from any Twitter, Flickr, and RSS feeds that have been configured. Content orients to the user when activated, and each item can be flipped over to reveal a Microsoft Tag on the back, which lets a visitor take the content with them outside of the venue. The app can be easily styled of match the brand of an event or venue, and administrators can remove objectionable content with no hassle.
